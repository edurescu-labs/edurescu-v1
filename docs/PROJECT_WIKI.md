## Workflow Rules (Locked)

> **IMPORTANT:** These rules are locked because they reflect how we maintain quality and consistency in this repository.

### Rule #1 — Documentation-only changes are allowed here

**Clarification:** Chats may include pseudo-code, JSON contracts, or Prisma schema text for specification purposes, but must not include runnable implementation files/code.

- Only update documentation in this workflow branch.
- Do not modify application/runtime code.
- Keep changes minimal and focused.

### Rule #2 — Follow repo conventions

- Preserve existing formatting and headings.
- Use clear, concise wording.

### Rule #3 — Commit message style

- Use descriptive commit messages (e.g., `Docs: ...`).
